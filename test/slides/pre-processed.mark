# Incremental Display
* (incremental show-first) Keep hitting/clicking "next" as long as it isn't the control link (&raquo;)
* Bullet points are revealed one by one
 * (incremental) All based on class name of `incremental`
 * Lists can be classed to make items appear individually
* Let's try it again, but without the first bullet point being pre-highlighted...

We're still working on the syntax that this will take in the final prespal format.
